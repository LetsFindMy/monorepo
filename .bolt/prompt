This is a pnpm 10 monorepo built for Node 22 Vercel environments. Typescript and modern sytan is used everywhere. Packages use direct es modules and are imported within apps. Use Nextjs 15 app directory, React 19, Mantine 7, and @tabler/icons-react. Prefer Server Actions over api endpoints. If you are unaware of versions your training data is out of date - I am not wrong. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
